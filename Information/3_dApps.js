Decentralized Application (dapp)


A decentralized application (dapp) is an application built on a decentralized network that 
combines a smart contract and a frontend user interface. 




























On Ethereum, smart contracts are 
accessible and transparent – like open APIs – so your dapp can even include a smart contract 
that someone else has written.




Before learning about dapps, we should cover the blockchain basics and read about the 
Ethereum network and how it's decentralized.

A dapp has its backend code running on a decentralized peer-to-peer network. Contrast 
this with an app where the backend code is running on centralized servers.

A dapp can have frontend code and user interfaces written in any language (just like an app) 
to make calls to its backend. Furthermore, its frontend can get hosted on decentralized 
storage such as IPFS

Decentralized - dapps operate on Ethereum, an open public decentralized platform where no 
one person or group has control

Deterministic - dapps perform the same function irrespective of the environment in which 
they get executed

Turing complete - dapps can perform any action given the required resources

Isolated - dapps are executed in a virtual environment known as Ethereum Virtual Machine 
so that if the smart contract has a bug, it won’t hamper the normal functioning of the 
blockchain network

To introduce dapps, we need to introduce smart contracts – a dapp's backend 

A smart contract is code that lives on the Ethereum blockchain and runs exactly as 
programmed. Once smart contracts are deployed on the network you can't change them. 
Dapps can be decentralized because they are controlled by the logic written into the 
contract, not an individual or company. This also means you need to design your contracts 
very carefully and test them thoroughly.

BENEFITS OF DAPP DEVELOPMENT
Zero downtime – Once the smart contract is deployed and on the blockchain, the network as a 
whole will always be able to serve clients looking to interact with the contract. Malicious 
actors, therefore, cannot launch denial-of-service attacks targeted towards individual dapps.

Privacy – You don’t need to provide real-world identity to deploy or interact with a dapp.

Resistance to censorship – No single entity on the network can block users from submitting 
transactions, deploying dapps, or reading data from the blockchain.

Complete data integrity – Data stored on the blockchain is immutable and indisputable, 
thanks to cryptographic primitives. Malicious actors cannot forge transactions or other 
data that has already been made public.

Trustless computation/verifiable behavior – smart contracts can be analyzed and are 
guaranteed to execute in predictable ways, without the need to trust a central authority. 
This is not true in traditional models; for example, when we use online banking systems, 
we must trust that financial institutions will not misuse our financial data, tamper with 
records, or get hacked.
