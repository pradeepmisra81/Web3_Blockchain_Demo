Web 3.0

Defining features of Web 3.0 include decentralization; trustlessness and permissionlessness;
artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning; and connectivity and ubiquity.




























Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 represent successive, advanced iterations of the original Web 1.0 
of the 1990s and early 2000s.

Web 2.0 is the current version of the web with which we are all familiar, while Web 3.0 
represents its next phase, which will be decentralized, open, and of greater utility.

Innovations such as smartphones, mobile Internet access, and social networks have driven 
the exponential growth of Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 has disrupted sectors that fail to integrate the new web-based business model.

Web 1.0

Berners-Lee pioneered the early development of the Internet in 1990 when he was a 
computer scientist at European researcher CERN.2 By October 1990, Berners-Lee had 
written the three fundamental technologies that became the foundation of the web, 
including the very first webpage editor/browser (WorldWideWeb.app):

HTML: HyperText Markup Language, the markup or formatting language of the web
URI or URL: Uniform Resource Identifier or Locator, a unique address used to identify 
each resource on the web
HTTP: HyperText Transfer Protocol, which allows for the retrieval of linked resources 
from across the web3

Web 2.0
Web 2.0 refers to a paradigm shift in how the Internet is used. Over the past 15 to 20 years,
the bland webpages of Web 1.0 have been completely replaced by Web 2.0’s interactivity, 
social connectivity, and user-generated content. Web 2.0 makes it possible for user-generated 
content to be viewed by millions of people around the world virtually in an instant; 
this unparalleled reach has led to an explosion of this type of content in recent years.

The exponential growth of Web 2.0 has been driven by key innovations such as mobile Internet 
access and social networks, as well as the near-ubiquity of powerful mobile devices like 
iPhones and Android-powered devices. In the second decade of this millennium, these 
developments enabled the dominance of apps that greatly expanded online interactivity and 
utility—for example, Airbnb, Facebook (now Meta), Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, Uber, WhatsApp,
and YouTube, to name a few.
