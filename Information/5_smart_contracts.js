Smart Contract

A smart contract is code that lives on the Ethereum blockchain and runs exactly as 
programmed. 

Once smart contracts are deployed on the network you can't change them.

Dapps can be decentralized because they are controlled by the logic written into the 
contract, not an individual or company. This also means you need to design your contracts 
very carefully and test them thoroughly.


Smart contracts are simply computer programs stored on a blockchain that run when 
predetermined conditions are met. 

They typically are used to automate the execution of an agreement so that all participants 
can be immediately certain of the outcome, without any intermediaryâ€™s involvement or time 
loss. 

They can also automate a workflow, triggering the next action when conditions are met.

Smart contracts permit trusted transactions and agreements to be carried out among 
disparate, anonymous parties without the need for a central authority, legal system, 
or external enforcement mechanism.

Smart contracts render transactions traceable, transparent, and irreversible.
