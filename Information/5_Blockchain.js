Blockchain technology

Blockchain technology is a structure that stores transactional records, also known as the 
block, of the public in several databases, known as the “chain,” in a network connected 
through peer-to-peer nodes. Typically, this storage is referred to as a ‘digital ledger.’

Examples of few Blockchain networs:
1. Bitcoin Blockchain Network
2. Etherem Blockchain Network


























Every transaction in this ledger is authorized by the digital signature of the owner, 
which authenticates the transaction and safeguards it from tampering. Hence, the information
the digital ledger contains is highly secure.

In simpler words, the digital ledger is like a Google spreadsheet shared among numerous 
computers in a network, in which, the transactional records are stored based on actual 
purchases. The fascinating angle is that anybody can see the data, but they can’t corrupt 
it.
